# Blender-Guru-Tutorial

This model is something I started making the following [BlenderGuru Donut Tutorial for blender 4.0](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z). It’s currently not finished, and I plan on customizing it further, but it’s still able to be enjoyed by others, So I decided to scrapbook it.
